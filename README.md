## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following software installed on your computer:

- A web server (like Apache or Nginx)
- PHP (version 8.0 or higher)
- Composer (a dependency manager for PHP)
- A database server (like MySQL or SQLite)

## Step 1: Clone the Project

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tesarp1812/admin_transaksi.git
   ```

3. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd admin_transaksi
   ```

## Step 2: Install PHP

### Windows
1. Download [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) (includes PHP, MySQL, and Apache) and install it.
2. During installation, select the components you need and complete the setup.

### macOS
1. You can install PHP using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
   ```bash
   brew install php
   ```

### Linux
1. Install PHP and required extensions using the package manager:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install php php-cli php-mbstring php-xml php-curl
   ```

## Step 3: Install Composer

### All Platforms
1. Download Composer from the [official website](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Verify Installation
Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
composer --version
```

## Step 4: Install Laravel

1. Open your terminal/command prompt.
2. Run the following command to install Laravel globally:
   ```bash
   composer global require laravel/installer
   ```

3. Add Composer's global bin directory to your PATH (if not already done). The location varies by OS:
   - **Windows:** `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin`
   - **macOS/Linux:** Add `~/.composer/vendor/bin` to your `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc` file.

### Verify Installation
Run the following command:
```bash
laravel --version
```

## Step 5: Set Up the Project

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file and set up your database configuration:
   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
   DB_USERNAME=your_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

3. Generate an application key:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

## Step 6: Run the Application

1. Migrate the database and run seeders:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

   This command will apply any pending migrations and seed the database with initial data as defined in your seeder classes.

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

## Step 7: Access the Application

1. Open your web browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```
2. Open history Transaction web browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/transaction
   ```
3. Create Transaction web browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/transaction/create
   ```
You should see the default Laravel welcome page!

### Additional Notes
- For further development, you can install additional packages and set up routes, controllers, and views as needed.
- Consider using a version control system like Git for better project management.

This README provides a comprehensive guide to getting started with your Laravel project, including cloning the repository and running seeders. Adjust any specific commands or configurations based on your project's requirements!
